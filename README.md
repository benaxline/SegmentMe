# SegmentMe
A macOS application that uses DeepLabV3 from Apple's developer's website. The application takes in an image and creates a mask based on where the mouse click occurs. This attempts to create a one-click segmentation model. 

## Application

In this example, the user selects an image with a dog laying on a couch. They want to mask the dog, so they left-click on the dog.
